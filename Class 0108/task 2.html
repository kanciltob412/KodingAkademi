    <p>One particular book which is recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer by</u> John <u>Grisham</u>. This book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The Street Lawyer</u> is a <b><i>great</i></b> book. It is <b><i>well written</i></b> and <b><i>interesting.</i></b> Other books by <u>John Grisham</u> include <u>The Firm</u>, <u>The Pelican Brief</u>, and <u>The Client</u>.</p>
